A WiFi Jammer with multiple attack modes
  1. Unarmed - Only sniffs for handshakes & beacon frames to find new APs
  2. Target - Only target specific AP's
  3. Spray - Attack every AP until a WPA2 handshake is acquired, then move on
  4. Jammer - Attack every AP

Options included to ignore certain APs by ESSID or BSSID, using a second WiFi interface (allowing dedicating sending and receiving), to customise channel hopping, and to add a .pcap file to write handshakes to
Don't do anything I wouldn't recommend you to do with this <3
